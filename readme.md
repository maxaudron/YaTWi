# Yet another Teamspeak Webinterface  
YaTWi strives to be a simplistic, sleek looking and fast Webinterface for Teamspeak.  

## Current Status  
YaTWi currently is in a very early alpha phase with only a dashboard view working.
Design elements aren't completely finished and there are bugs too expect.  

## Roadmap

### ToDo  
* Dashboard quick actions

## Testing
